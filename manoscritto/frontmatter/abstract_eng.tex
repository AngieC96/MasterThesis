An essential task in the operation of power systems is restoration after a blackout. The restoration process returns the system back to normal operation after a fault happened on the electrical line. Restoration has traditionally been performed by distribution system technicians, assisted by guidelines developed by utilities using knowledge gained through experience.

Our aim was to develop an algorithm that could help the technicians in their decisions, and that can be used to simulate the process of restoring the operation of the power grid. We framed the problem using a partially observable Markov decision process, and we solved it using a policy gradient method.
