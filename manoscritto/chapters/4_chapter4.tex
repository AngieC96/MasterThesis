As described in \citep{SuttonBarto}, Reinforcement Learninig is an area of Machine Learning that analyzes how an agent can learn which actions to take in an environment based on some given reward. So the agent is not told which actions to take, but learns by trial-and-error which are the ones that leads to a bigger reward.
